# Tic-Tac-Toe Svelte 5

## A tic-tac-toe game written using Svelte 5 with Svelte-Kit

Why a tic-tac-toe game after so many years of writing codes in different languages? The answer is rather simple. I never found `js` to be an interesting language. Yet, I thought that sooner or later I might need to learn a front-end `js` framework. I went throught the introductory tutorial of `React` and did not like the philosophy. So I picked up `Svelte` (`Svelte 4`). And two days after I had begun learning the basics, they released `Svelte 5`. So, here it is, a tic-tac-toe game written in `Svelte 5`. To be clear, I still do not consider that I know `js`, let alone `Svelte` or `Svelte-Kit`. The project is built in `Google IDX`.

I am leaving the rest of the default README file as it is.

## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
